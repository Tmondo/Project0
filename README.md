For the flashcards i would like to provide some user friendly functionality.

I would like users to be able to do the following from the main page
  - Log in
  - Create stacks of cards
  - View saved stacks 
  

While viewing a stack of cards
  - share stacks of cards with other users on the website
  - Save stacks of cards
  - add or remove cards from stacks at any point in time
  - edit the information on the cards
  - users could click the stack to flip the card from one side to the other
  - there will be a correct or incorrect button to move to the next card
  - once all cards are cycled through the user should have the option to review incorrect cards
